## My project

For my project, I will analyze data on colorectal cancers in Ethiopia, found online. 

## Execute the analysis

To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run 

``` bash
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('report.Rmd')"
```

This will create a file called `report.html` output in your directory that contains the results.
